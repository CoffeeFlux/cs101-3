We considereded functions whose output is $+1$ or $-1$ when using `interf1` and `interf2`. Of course, we don't need to limit ourselves to these values, since it's possible to perform interference with other values as well. The most natural extension to $d$ values that add up to $0$ is to consider the $d$ roots of unity:\n",

You can, however, take an existing problem and modify it to come up with a different one.\n",
